Crafting Components
Integral Pieces
<&mech_components>Many machines and tools are constructed from various sub-components. Some of these you will have to use on a regular basis, which is why they have their own entry in this manual. The §6Iron§r and §6Steel Mechanical Components§r are integral to the majority of Multiblocks and machinery.
<&create_bp>As you will find yourself creating these components more frequently, it may be advisable to draft a <link;blueprints;§o§nBlueprint§r> for them. Using this blueprint in an <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r> will allow you to construct the components at a reduced cost.
The workbench recipes are found on the following page.
<&tubes>Another, albeit less frequently used component are §6Vacuum Tubes§r. These glass tubes are used as elements in electronic machinery and used in <link;lighting;§o§nlight emitting devices§r>.
<&pcb>A rarely used, but crucial component in advanced machinery that requires precise calculation is the §6Circuit Board§r. They are impractically large and clunky, but can perform basic mathematic operations in under a second!
