Sawmill
???
The sawmill cuts logs into planks. More text goes here later!
Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will stop the machine, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Screwdriver.
The structure is formed by right clicking the central sheetmetal block at the front.
