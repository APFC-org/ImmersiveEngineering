Things to do before the release. Not a complete list, but a list of things that are likely to be forgotten if they aren't on a list somewhere.
 - Test auto workbench and check that behavior matches 1.12
 - Port missing manual entries
 - Rendering formed structures in the manual is probably broken right now
   - Render OBJs/block models directly rather than item models?
